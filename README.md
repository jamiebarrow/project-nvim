# nvim

This repo contains my nvim configs and resources.

Currently it will follow the [Advent of Neovim playlist][1] on YouTube by [TJ DeVries][2].

Since I am on Windows, I set this up using a junction point which is like a hard link to the repo under %LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim

```cmd
mklink /J %LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim REPO_PATH
```
